CmdSearch comes with a handful of default search urls but here is a collection of some common search urls so you don't have to find them yourself.
(I don't include google, youtube, etc... because those are in the default drop down)

If have a useful URL not on this list and want to contribute, please leave a comment [here](https://github.com/SpaceshipCaptain/CmdSearch/issues/3).
